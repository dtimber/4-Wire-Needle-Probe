# 4-Wire-Needle-Probe
4-Wire-Needle-Probe for low resistance measurements (down to µΩ-Range).

![Front](https://github.com/dtimber/4-Wire-Needle-Probe/blob/main/Pictures/Preview.jpg)

A PCB is used to solder on two P75-B1 test needles. Distance between needle tips is 1 mm. Therefore measurements on pads of components with case size 0805 is possible.

Parts needed per probe:

front probe body
rear probe body
PCB from Github link
P75-B1 test needles (2 pieces)
RG174-cable (with BNC connector)
heatshrink tube (inner diameter before shrinking 6.4 mm / shrinking rate 3:1)
adapter (BNC female to banana plugs)
